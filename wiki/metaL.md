# `meta`programming `L`anguage

`metaL` provides a portable layer over Python or any other object-oriented language having the goal of high-level programming abstractions, metaprogramming in a wide with code generation, and software transformation approach (including legacy raking for obsoleted software or language stacks).

`metaL` is not a programming language in a text form, its native form in the [[object graph]], so it does not need any syntax parser, or storing programs in files. The primary storage for metaL programs is the RAM, which can be *optionally* backed by any key/value storage or RDBMS.

*Parser not needed, there is no syntax*, as you should construct and manipulate `metaL` structures using any other programming language you feel handy and friendly for your own.
