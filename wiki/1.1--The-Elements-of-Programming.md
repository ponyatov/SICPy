# 1.1  The Elements of Programming
  * [[1.1.1  Expressions]]

A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also forces a mindset within which we organize our thinking about computation. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay huge attention to the means that the language semantics, and its ability to combine ideas
* **primitive expressions** represent the simplest entities in the language
* **means of combination** allow compound elements are built from simpler ones
* **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as first-class units

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. The right programming language should be able to treat procedures as generic data at the same time and have to have features to do code manipulation at a high abstraction level.
