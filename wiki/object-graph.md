The object graph is a network of interconnected objects which form a directed cyclic graph with typed and attributed nodes.

Due to the use of a special form of nodes which able to represent any data container or scalar value simultaneously, the object graph provides good, easy to use and understand data model, which can be also treated as the **executable data** (c) equivalent to program = data.
